        <h2>Why visit this website?</h2>
        <p>Music is an integral part of learning that has been overlooked by the Ontario education system. Typically, students are influenced to focus on math, sciences and English throughout elementary and high school. Studies show that music not only improves students' ability to learn, but can have a large effect on mood. We believe that categorizing our game into different genres/moods will promote good mental health and well-being. Browse through our website to learn more about the history of music as well as different genres. This website not only educates users using music and trivia, but caters to YOUR mood. How are you feeling today?</p>
